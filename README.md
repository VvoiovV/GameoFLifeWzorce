# Game of Life in Python

---

## Description
This project is an implementation of John Conway's **Game of Life** in Python. The application simulates the evolution of cells on a two-dimensional grid based on predefined rules, allowing the user to observe dynamic patterns emerging during the simulation.

---

## Features
- Initializes a random starting grid of cells.
- Visualizes successive generations in the console.
- Allows customization of the grid size and the number of generations.
- Implements GOL rules: survival, birth, and death of cells.
